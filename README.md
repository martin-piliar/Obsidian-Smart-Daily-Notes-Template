## Prerequisites

- Obsidian v1.8.7+
- Templater plugin

## Installation

1. Install the [Templater](https://github.com/SilentVoid13/Templater) plugin in Obsidian
2. Copy `template.md` to your Obsidian templates folder
3. Configure the template path in your daily notes settings
4. Customize the file path in the template to match your vault structure

## How It Works

Let's break down the key components:

### 1. Date Initialization
```javascript
const currentNoteDate = moment(tp.file.title.split('-').slice(0,3).join('-'), 'YYYY-MM-DD');
let checkDate = currentNoteDate.clone().subtract(1, 'days');
```
This gets us started with yesterday's date.

### 2. Smart Search Logic
```javascript
const maxDaysToLook = 14;  // Safety limit
let daysChecked = 0;
while (!fileFound && daysChecked < maxDaysToLook) {
```
We'll look back up to 14 days, preventing any infinite loops. This is handy for longer breaks or holidays.

### 3. File Path Handling
```javascript
const fileName = `${checkDate.format('YYYY-MM-DD')}-${checkDate.format('dddd')}`;
const filePath = `${fileName}.md`;  // Customize this based on your folder structure
```
The template is flexible - you can add your own folder path here based on your vault structure.

### 4. Content Validation
```javascript
const content = await app.vault.adapter.read(filePath);
const workSection = content.match(/# Work\n([\s\S]*?)(?=\n#|$)/);

if (workSection && workSection[1].trim().length > 0) {
```
This checks if the file exists and has actual content in the Work section.

## Customization

### File Path Structure
Modify the `filePath` line to match your vault structure:
```javascript
const filePath = `Daily Notes/${fileName}.md`;
const filePath = `Journal/${fileName}.md`;
const filePath = `Notes/Daily/${fileName}.md`;
```

### Lookback Period
Adjust how many days the template looks back:
```javascript
const maxDaysToLook = 14;  // Change this number
```

### Section Names
Modify the section headers and matching patterns:
```javascript
const workSection = content.match(/# Work\n([\s\S]*?)(?=\n#|$)/);
// Change to match your section names
```

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Template Not Working**
   - Check if Templater is enabled
   - Verify template folder path
   - Ensure file paths match your structure

2. **No Previous Items Showing**
   - Verify previous notes exist
   - Check if Work section has content
   - Confirm file paths match your structure

3. **Error Messages**
   - Check Templater syntax
   - Verify JavaScript syntax
   - Ensure section headers match template
